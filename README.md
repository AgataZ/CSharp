School of C# (Test-Driven Learning)
================

A project aimed to help learn and master programming using C# with a Test-Driven Approach.Think about it as a Book with examples, but without any text and only examples (the fun part), where the knowledge is expressed on comments and Unit Tests.

Before you start this class, let's define some basic concepts:

.NET:Framework created to provide a CLR and FCL for developers that use Microsoft Technologies

CLR: Common Language Runtime - Virtual Machine that provides certain services to the Developer, such as:
 - Memory Management
 - Security
 - Operating System Independence
 - Language Independence

FCL: Framework Class Library - Set of Classes that provides common functionality such as:
 - Window applications
 - Web Applications
 - Web Services 
 - Network
 - File I/O

Topics:

 - Fundamentals
 - Classes and Objects 
 - Types (In Progress)
 - Events (In Progress)
