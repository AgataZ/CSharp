School of C#
================

A project aimed to help learn and master programming using C# by viewing examples of the most common functionalities of the language.Think about it as a Book with examples, but without any text and only examples (the fun part), where the knowledge is expressed on comments.

Before you start this class, let's define some basic concepts:

.NET:Framework created to provide a CLR and FCL for developers that use Microsoft Technologies

CLR: Common Language Runtime - Virtual Machine that provides certain services to the Developer, such as:
 - Memory Management
 - Security
 - Operating System Independence
 - Language Independence

FCL: Framework Class Library - Set of Classes that provides common functionality such as:
 - Window applications
 - Web Applications
 - Web Services 
 - Network
